The visualizations focus on comparing the number of verified instances and the verified average time across different methods, including a pgd attack upper bound line.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the required dependencies installed. For example, you can install seaborn with:

```bash
conda install seaborn
```

## How to Use

Simply open and run the `visualization.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook to see the plots in action.
